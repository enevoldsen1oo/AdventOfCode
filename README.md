🎄🔥 Advent of Code — Prolog & Haskell Edition 🔥🎄
Where brain cells go to cry, and logic goes to flex
🧠 Welcome, traveller…

Yoyoyo, step into the realm where Prolog and Haskell collide harder than two shopping carts in Bilka on December 23rd.

This repo contains my solutions to Advent of Code, written in:

🟣 Prolog (powered by swipl) — because sometimes you want the computer to do the thinking.

🟡 Haskell (powered by ghci) — because why not solve puzzles with a language that's basically a math major.

🚀 Running the Magic
🔮 Prolog

Fire up:

swipl <file.pl>


Then ask it politely to do your bidding.

🔥 Haskell

Summon the interpreter:

ghci <file.hs>


Let the types guide you. Or haunt you. Depends.

🎁 What’s inside?

Day 1-∞: Pure logic. Pure functional. Pure chaos.

Solutions, experiments, and questionable decisions.

Code written at 02:00 with Christmas cookies as the only fuel.

🎅 Why both languages?

Because:

Prolog feels like telling your friend a riddle and watching them suffer.

Haskell feels like solving the same riddle but with divine math powers.

Together?
Unstoppable.

🧦 Merry Codemas, homie.

May your recursion terminate and your predicates never fail. 🎄✨
